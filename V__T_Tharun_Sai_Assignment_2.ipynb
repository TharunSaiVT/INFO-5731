The proposed approach incorporates sensor fusion by taking advantage of the CNN structure to achieve higher and more robust diagnosis accuracy. Both temporal and spatial information of the raw data from multiple sensors is considered during the training process of the CNN. Representative features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. It avoids manual feature extraction or selection, which relies heavily on prior knowledge of specific machinery and fault types. The effectiveness of the developed method is evaluated by using datasets from two types of typical rotating machinery, roller bearings, and gearboxes. Compared with traditional approaches using manual feature extraction, the results show the superior diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The present approach can be extended to fault diagnosis of other machinery with various types of sensors due to its end to end feature learning capability.\",\n          \"Much of the world's knowledge is recorded in natural language text, but making effective use of it in this form poses a major challenge.

Irrespective of how a diagnostic tool is derived, it must be evaluated using a 3-step process of deriving, validating, and establishing the clinical effectiveness of the tool. Machine learning-based tools should also be assessed for the type of machine learning model used and its appropriateness for the input data type and data set size. Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set. On the validation set, the outcome against which the model is evaluated is termed the reference standard. The rigor of the reference standard must be assessed, such as against a universally accepted gold standard or expert grading.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2320,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The performance of biometric systems based on automatic speaker recognition technology is severely degraded due to spoofing attacks with synthetic speech generated using diff erent voice conversion VC and speech synthesis SS techniques Various countermeasures are proposed to detect this type of attack and in this context choosing an appropriate feature extraction technique for capturing relevant information from speech is an important issue This paper presents a concise experimental review of different features for synthetic speech detection task A wide variety of features considered in this stud y include previously investigated features as well as some other potentially useful features for characterizing real and sy nthetic speech The experiments are conducted on recently released ASVspoof 2015 corpus containing speech data from a large number of VC and SS technique Comparative results using two different classifiers indicate that features representing spectral information in highfrequency region dynamic information of speech and detailed information related to subband characteristics are considerably more useful in detecting synthetic sp eech Index Terms antispoofing ASVspoof 2015 feature extraction countermeasures\",\n          \"Much of the worlds knowledge is recorded in natural language text but making effective use of it in this form poses a major challenge Information extraction converts this knowledge to a structured form suitable for computer manipulation opening up many possibilities for using it In this review the author describes the processing pipeline of information extraction how the pipeline components are trained and how this training can be made more efficient He also describes some of the challenges that must be addressed for information extraction to become a more widely used technology\",\n          \"Significance Proteins often function poorly when used outside their natural contexts directed evolution can be used to engineer them to be more efficient in new roles We propose that the expense of experimentally testing a large number of protein variants can be decreased and the outcome can be improved by incorporating machine learning with directed evolution Simulations on an empirical fitness landscape demonstrate that the expected performance improvement is greater with this approach Machine learningassisted directed evolution from a single parent produced enzyme variants that selectively synthesize the enantiomeric products of a newtonature chemical transformation By exploring multiple mutations simultaneously machine learning efficiently navigates large regions of sequence space to identify improved proteins and also produces diverse solutions to engineering problems To reduce experimental effort associated with directed protein evolution and to explore the sequence space encoded by mutating multiple positions simultaneously we incorporate machine learning into the directed evolution workflow Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally but machinelearning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally We validated this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB1 binding protein demonstrating that machine learningguided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers ie stereodivergence of a newtonature carbene SiH insertion reaction The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with 93 and 79 ee enantiomeric excess By greatly increasing throughput with in silico modeling machine learning enhances the quality and diversity of sequence solutions for a protein engineering problem\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Both temporal and spatial information of the raw data from multiple sensors is considered during the training process of the CNN. Representative features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. It avoids manual feature extraction or selection, which relies heavily on prior knowledge of specific machinery and fault types. The effectiveness of the developed method is evaluated by using datasets from two types of typical rotating machinery, roller bearings, and gearboxes. Compared with traditional approaches using manual feature extraction, the results show the superior diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The present approach can be extended to fault diagnosis of other machinery with various types of sensors due to its end to end feature learning capability.\",\n          \"Much of the world's knowledge is recorded in natural language text, but making effective use of it in this form poses a major challenge. Information extraction converts this knowledge to a structured form suitable for computer manipulation, opening up many possibilities for using it. In this review, the author describes the processing pipeline of information extraction, how the pipeline components are trained, and how this training can be made more efficient. He also describes some of the challenges that must be addressed for information extraction to become a more widely used technology.\",\n          \"In recent years, many new clinical diagnostic tools have been developed using complicated machine learning methods. Irrespective of how a diagnostic tool is derived, it must be evaluated using a 3-step process of deriving, validating, and establishing the clinical effectiveness of the tool. Machine learning-based tools should also be assessed for the type of machine learning model used and its appropriateness for the input data type and data set size. Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set. On the validation set, the outcome against which the model is evaluated is termed the reference standard. The rigor of the reference standard must be assessed, such as against a universally accepted gold standard or expert grading.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2321,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery.

Existing large-scale benchmarks for this task have focused mostly on textual sources, i.e. unstructured information, and thus ignored the wealth of information available in structured formats, such as tables. In this paper we introduce a novel dataset and benchmark, Fact Extraction and VERification Over Unstructured and Structured information (FEVEROUS), which consists of , verified claims. Each claim is annotated with evidence in the form of sentences and/or cells from tables in Wikipedia, as well as a label indicating whether this evidence supports, refutes, or does not provide enough information to reach a verdict. Furthermore, we detail our efforts to track and minimize the biases present in the dataset and could be exploited by models, e.g. being able to predict the label without using evidence. Finally, we develop a baseline for verifying claims against text and tables which predicts both the correct evidence and verdict for % of the claims.\",\n          \"Significance Proteins often function poorly when used outside their natural contexts; directed evolution can be used to engineer them to be more efficient in new roles. We propose that the expense of experimentally testing a large number of protein variants can be decreased and the outcome can be improved by incorporating machine learning with directed evolution. Simulations on an empirical fitness landscape demonstrate that the expected performance improvement is greater with this approach. Machine learning-assisted directed evolution from a single parent produced enzyme variants that selectively synthesize the enantiomeric products of a new-to-nature chemical transformation. By exploring multiple mutations simultaneously, machine learning efficiently navigates large regions of sequence space to identify improved proteins and also produces diverse solutions to engineering problems. To reduce experimental effort associated with directed protein evolution and to explore the sequence space encoded by mutating multiple positions simultaneously, we incorporate machine learning into the directed evolution workflow. Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally, but machine-learning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally. We validated this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB binding protein, demonstrating that machine learning-guided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches. We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers (i.e., stereodivergence) of a new-to-nature carbene Si\\u2013H insertion reaction. The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with % and % ee (enantiomeric excess). By greatly increasing throughput with in silico modeling, machine learning enhances the quality and diversity of sequence solutions for a protein engineering problem.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The proposed approach incorporates sensor fusion by taking advantage of the CNN structure to achieve higher and more robust diagnosis accuracy. Both temporal and spatial information of the raw data from multiple sensors is considered during the training process of the CNN. Representative features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. It avoids manual feature extraction or selection, which relies heavily on prior knowledge of specific machinery and fault types. The effectiveness of the developed method is evaluated by using datasets from two types of typical rotating machinery, roller bearings, and gearboxes. Compared with traditional approaches using manual feature extraction, the results show the superior diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The present approach can be extended to fault diagnosis of other machinery with various types of sensors due to its end to end feature learning capability.\",\n          \"Much of the world's knowledge is recorded in natural language text, but making effective use of it in this form poses a major challenge.

He also describes some of the challenges that must be addressed for information extraction to become a more widely used technology.\",\n          \"In recent years, many new clinical diagnostic tools have been developed using complicated machine learning methods. Irrespective of how a diagnostic tool is derived, it must be evaluated using a 3-step process of deriving, validating, and establishing the clinical effectiveness of the tool. Machine learning-based tools should also be assessed for the type of machine learning model used and its appropriateness for the input data type and data set size. Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set. On the validation set, the outcome against which the model is evaluated is termed the reference standard. The rigor of the reference standard must be assessed, such as against a universally accepted gold standard or expert grading.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2322,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"temporal logic: from ancient ideas to artificial intelligence deals with the history of temporal logic as well as the crucial systematic questions within the field. the book studies the rich contributions from ancient and medieval philosophy up to the downfall of temporal logic in the renaissance. the modern rediscovery of the subject, which is especially due to the work of a. n. prior, is described, leading into a thorough discussion of the use of temporal logic in computer science and the understanding of natural language. temporal logic: from ancient ideas to artificial intelligence thus interweaves linguistic, philosophical and computational aspects into an informative and inspiring whole.\",\n          \"abstract open data (od) is an emerging term in the process of defining how scientific data may be published and re-used without price or permission barriers. scientists generally see published data as belonging to the scientific community, but many publishers claim copyright over data and will not allow its re-use without permission. this is a major impediment to the progress of scholarship in the digital age. this article reviews the need for open data, shows examples of why open data are valuable, and summarizes some early initiatives in formalizing the right of access to and re-use of scientific data.\",\n          \"extraction of formant information from linear\\u2010prediction phase spectra is proposed. it is shown that the derivative of phase spectrum gives reliable formant information. since the phase spectra for several resonators in cascade are additive, the resonance peaks are additive in the derivative of the phase spectrum unlike in the magnitude spectrum and hence the problem of identifying merged peaks is very easily solved by this method. application of the method is illustrated through examples of linear\\u2010prediction spectra obtained for simulated models and for actural speech segments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The proposed approach incorporates sensor fusion by taking advantage of the CNN structure to achieve higher and more robust diagnosis accuracy. Both temporal and spatial information of the raw data from multiple sensors is considered during the training process of the CNN. Representative features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. It avoids manual feature extraction or selection, which relies heavily on prior knowledge of specific machinery and fault types. The effectiveness of the developed method is evaluated by using datasets from two types of typical rotating machinery, roller bearings, and gearboxes. Compared with traditional approaches using manual feature extraction, the results show the superior diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The present approach can be extended to fault diagnosis of other machinery with various types of sensors due to its end to end feature learning capability.\",\n          \"Much of the world's knowledge is recorded in natural language text, but making effective use of it in this form poses a major challenge.

The proposed approach incorporates sensor fusion by taking advantage of the CNN structure to achieve higher and more robust diagnosis accuracy. Both temporal and spatial information of the raw data from multiple sensors is considered during the training process of the CNN. Representative features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. It avoids manual feature extraction or selection, which relies heavily on prior knowledge of specific machinery and fault types. The effectiveness of the developed method is evaluated by using datasets from two types of typical rotating machinery, roller bearings, and gearboxes. Compared with traditional approaches using manual feature extraction, the results show the superior diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The present approach can be extended to fault diagnosis of other machinery with various types of sensors due to its end to end feature learning capability.\",\n          \"Much of the world's knowledge is recorded in natural language text, but making effective use of it in this form poses a major challenge. Information extraction converts this knowledge to a structured form suitable for computer manipulation, opening up many possibilities for using it. In this review, the author describes the processing pipeline of information extraction, how the pipeline components are trained, and how this training can be made more efficient. He also describes some of the challenges that must be addressed for information extraction to become a more widely used technology.\",\n          \"In recent years, many new clinical diagnostic tools have been developed using complicated machine learning methods. Irrespective of how a diagnostic tool is derived, it must be evaluated using a 3-step process of deriving, validating, and establishing the clinical effectiveness of the tool. Machine learning-based tools should also be assessed for the type of machine learning model used and its appropriateness for the input data type and data set size. Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set. On the validation set, the outcome against which the model is evaluated is termed the reference standard. The rigor of the reference standard must be assessed, such as against a universally accepted gold standard or expert grading.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2322,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"temporal logic: from ancient ideas to artificial intelligence deals with the history of temporal logic as well as the crucial systematic questions within the field. the book studies the rich contributions from ancient and medieval philosophy up to the downfall of temporal logic in the renaissance. the modern rediscovery of the subject, which is especially due to the work of a. n. prior, is described, leading into a thorough discussion of the use of temporal logic in computer science and the understanding of natural language. temporal logic: from ancient ideas to artificial intelligence thus interweaves linguistic, philosophical and computational aspects into an informative and inspiring whole.\",\n          \"abstract open data (od) is an emerging term in the process of defining how scientific data may be published and re-used without price or permission barriers. scientists generally see published data as belonging to the scientific community, but many publishers claim copyright over data and will not allow its re-use without permission. this is a major impediment to the progress of scholarship in the digital age. this article reviews the need for open data, shows examples of why open data are valuable, and summarizes some early initiatives in formalizing the right of access to and re-use of scientific data.\",\n          \"extraction of formant information from linear\\u2010prediction phase spectra is proposed. it is shown that the derivative of phase spectrum gives reliable formant information. since the phase spectra for several resonators in cascade are additive, the resonance peaks are additive in the derivative of the phase spectrum unlike in the magnitude spectrum and hence the problem of identifying merged peaks is very easily solved by this method. application of the method is illustrated through examples of linear\\u2010prediction spectra obtained for simulated models and for actural speech segments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract_without_stopwords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2321,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"paper presents convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach fault diagnosis rotating machinery. proposed approach incorporates sensor fusion taking advantage CNN structure achieve higher robust diagnosis accuracy. temporal spatial information raw data multiple sensors considered training process CNN.

The proposed approach incorporates sensor fusion by taking advantage of the CNN structure to achieve higher and more robust diagnosis accuracy. Both temporal and spatial information of the raw data from multiple sensors is considered during the training process of the CNN. Representative features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. It avoids manual feature extraction or selection, which relies heavily on prior knowledge of specific machinery and fault types. The effectiveness of the developed method is evaluated by using datasets from two types of typical rotating machinery, roller bearings, and gearboxes. Compared with traditional approaches using manual feature extraction, the results show the superior diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The present approach can be extended to fault diagnosis of other machinery with various types of sensors due to its end to end feature learning capability.\",\n          \"Much of the world's knowledge is recorded in natural language text, but making effective use of it in this form poses a major challenge.

Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set.
