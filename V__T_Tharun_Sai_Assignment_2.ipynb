We describe a solver for Support Vector Machine training running on a GPU, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm and an adaptive first and second order working set selection heuristic, which achieves speedups of 9-35x over LIBSVM running on a traditional processor. We also present a GPU-based system for SVM classification which achieves speedups of 81-138x over LIBSVM (5-24x over our own CPU based SVM classifier).\",\n          \"This paper presents a new approach to authenticate individuals using triangulation of hand vein images and simultaneous extraction of knuckle shape information. The proposed method is fully automated and employs palm dorsal hand vein images acquired from the low-cost, near infrared, contactless imaging. The knuckle tips are used as key points for the image normalization and extraction of region of interest. The matching scores are generated in two parallel stages: (i) hierarchical matching score from the four topologies of triangulation in the binarized vein structures and (ii) from the geometrical features consisting of knuckle point perimeter distances in the acquired images. The weighted score level combination from these two matching scores are used to authenticate the individuals. The achieved experimental results from the proposed system using contactless palm dorsal-hand vein images are promising (equal error rate of 1.14%) and suggest more user friendly alternative for user identification.\",\n          \"Most existing joint neural models for Information Extraction (IE) use local task-specific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances (e.g., trigger, relation) regardless of their interactions. For example, a victim of a die event is likely to be a victim of an attack event in the same sentence. In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, OneIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. OneIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state of-the-art on all subtasks. In addition, as OneIE does not use any language-specific feature, we prove it can be easily applied to new languages or trained in a multilingual manner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2491,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Recent developments in programmable highly parallel Graphics Processing Units GPUs have enabled high performance implementations of machine learning algorithms We describe a solver for Support Vector Machine training running on a GPU using the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm and an adaptive first and second order working set selection heuristic which achieves speedups of 935x over LIBSVM running on a traditional processor We also present a GPUbased system for SVM classification which achieves speedups of 81138x over LIBSVM 524x over our own CPU based SVM classifier\",\n          \"Information retrieval is an important application area of naturallanguage processing where one encounters the genuine challenge of processing large quantities of unrestricted naturallanguage text This paper reports on the application of a few simple yet robust and efficient nounphrase analysis techniques to create better indexing phrases for information retrieval In particular we describe an hybrid approach to the extraction of meaningful continuous or discontinuous subcompounds from complex noun phrases using both corpus statistics and linguistic heuristics Results of experiments show that indexing based on such extracted subcompound improves both recall and precision in an information retrieval system The nounphrase analysis techniques are also potentially useful for book indexing and automatic thesaurus extraction\",\n          \"Most existing joint neural models for Information Extraction IE use local taskspecific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances eg trigger relation regardless of their interactions For example a victim of a die event is likely to be a victim of an attack event in the same sentence In order to capture such crosssubtask and crossinstance interdependencies we propose a joint neural framework OneIE that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence OneIE performs endtoend IE in four stages 1 Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations 2 Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes 3 Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers 4 Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder At the decoding stage we incorporate global features to capture the crosssubtask and crossinstance interactions Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state oftheart on all subtasks In addition as OneIE does not use any languagespecific feature we prove it can be easily applied to new languages or trained in a multilingual manner\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We describe a solver for Support Vector Machine training running on a GPU, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm and an adaptive first and second order working set selection heuristic, which achieves speedups of 9-35x over LIBSVM running on a traditional processor. We also present a GPU-based system for SVM classification which achieves speedups of 81-138x over LIBSVM (5-24x over our own CPU based SVM classifier).\",\n          \"This paper presents a new approach to authenticate individuals using triangulation of hand vein images and simultaneous extraction of knuckle shape information. The proposed method is fully automated and employs palm dorsal hand vein images acquired from the low-cost, near infrared, contactless imaging. The knuckle tips are used as key points for the image normalization and extraction of region of interest. The matching scores are generated in two parallel stages: (i) hierarchical matching score from the four topologies of triangulation in the binarized vein structures and (ii) from the geometrical features consisting of knuckle point perimeter distances in the acquired images. The weighted score level combination from these two matching scores are used to authenticate the individuals. The achieved experimental results from the proposed system using contactless palm dorsal-hand vein images are promising (equal error rate of 1.14%) and suggest more user friendly alternative for user identification.\",\n          \"Most existing joint neural models for Information Extraction (IE) use local task-specific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances (e.g., trigger, relation) regardless of their interactions. For example, a victim of a die event is likely to be a victim of an attack event in the same sentence. In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, OneIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. OneIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state of-the-art on all subtasks. In addition, as OneIE does not use any language-specific feature, we prove it can be easily applied to new languages or trained in a multilingual manner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2491,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite. We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author. We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm. We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine learning techniques and human judges on this task. Perhaps unsurprisingly, neither the human judges nor the machine learning techniques perform very well.\",\n          \"While traditional information extraction systems have been built to answer questions about facts, subjective information extraction systems will answer questions about feelings and opinions. A crucial step towards this goal is identifying the words and phrases that express opinions in text. Indeed, although much previous work has relied on the identification of opinion expressions for a variety of sentiment-based NLP tasks, none has focused directly on this important supporting task. Moreover, none of the proposed methods for identification of opinion expressions has been evaluated at the task that they were designed to perform. We present an approach for identifying opinion expressions that uses conditional random fields and we evaluate the approach at the expression-level using a standard sentiment corpus. Our approach achieves expression-level performance within % of the human interannotator agreement.\",\n          \"Information extraction suffers from its varying targets, heterogeneous structures, and demand-specific schemas. In this paper, we propose a unified text-to-structure generation framework, namely UIE, which can universally model different IE tasks, adaptively generate targeted structures, and collaboratively learn general IE abilities from different knowledge sources. Specifically, UIE uniformly encodes different extraction structures via a structured extraction language, adaptively generates target extractions via a schema-based prompt mechanism \\u2013 structural schema instructor, and captures the common IE abilities via a large-scale pretrained text-to-structure model. Experiments show that UIE achieved the state-of-the-art performance on  IE tasks,  datasets, and on all supervised, low-resource, and few-shot settings for a wide range of entity, relation, event and sentiment extraction tasks and their unification. These results verified the effectiveness, universality, and transferability of UIE.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The proposed method is fully automated and employs palm dorsal hand vein images acquired from the low-cost, near infrared, contactless imaging. The knuckle tips are used as key points for the image normalization and extraction of region of interest. The matching scores are generated in two parallel stages: (i) hierarchical matching score from the four topologies of triangulation in the binarized vein structures and (ii) from the geometrical features consisting of knuckle point perimeter distances in the acquired images. The weighted score level combination from these two matching scores are used to authenticate the individuals. The achieved experimental results from the proposed system using contactless palm dorsal-hand vein images are promising (equal error rate of 1.14%) and suggest more user friendly alternative for user identification.\",\n          \"Most existing joint neural models for Information Extraction (IE) use local task-specific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances (e.g., trigger, relation) regardless of their interactions. For example, a victim of a die event is likely to be a victim of an attack event in the same sentence. In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, OneIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. OneIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state of-the-art on all subtasks. In addition, as OneIE does not use any language-specific feature, we prove it can be easily applied to new languages or trained in a multilingual manner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2493,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"recent developments in programmable, highly parallel graphics processing units (gpus) have enabled high performance implementations of machine learning algorithms. we describe a solver for support vector machine training running on a gpu, using the sequential minimal optimization algorithm and an adaptive first and second order working set selection heuristic, which achieves speedups of 9-35x over libsvm running on a traditional processor. we also present a gpu-based system for svm classification which achieves speedups of 81-138x over libsvm (5-24x over our own cpu based svm classifier).\",\n          \"this paper presents a new approach to authenticate individuals using triangulation of hand vein images and simultaneous extraction of knuckle shape information. the proposed method is fully automated and employs palm dorsal hand vein images acquired from the low-cost, near infrared, contactless imaging. the knuckle tips are used as key points for the image normalization and extraction of region of interest. the matching scores are generated in two parallel stages: (i) hierarchical matching score from the four topologies of triangulation in the binarized vein structures and (ii) from the geometrical features consisting of knuckle point perimeter distances in the acquired images. the weighted score level combination from these two matching scores are used to authenticate the individuals. the achieved experimental results from the proposed system using contactless palm dorsal-hand vein images are promising (equal error rate of 1.14%) and suggest more user friendly alternative for user identification.\",\n          \"most existing joint neural models for information extraction (ie) use local task-specific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances (e.g., trigger, relation) regardless of their interactions. for example, a victim of a die event is likely to be a victim of an attack event in the same sentence. in order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, oneie, that aims to extract the globally optimal ie result as a graph from an input sentence. oneie performs end-to-end ie in four stages: (1) encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. at the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state of-the-art on all subtasks. in addition, as oneie does not use any language-specific feature, we prove it can be easily applied to new languages or trained in a multilingual manner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We describe a solver for Support Vector Machine training running on a GPU, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm and an adaptive first and second order working set selection heuristic, which achieves speedups of 9-35x over LIBSVM running on a traditional processor. We also present a GPU-based system for SVM classification which achieves speedups of 81-138x over LIBSVM (5-24x over our own CPU based SVM classifier).\",\n          \"This paper presents a new approach to authenticate individuals using triangulation of hand vein images and simultaneous extraction of knuckle shape information. The proposed method is fully automated and employs palm dorsal hand vein images acquired from the low-cost, near infrared, contactless imaging. The knuckle tips are used as key points for the image normalization and extraction of region of interest. The matching scores are generated in two parallel stages: (i) hierarchical matching score from the four topologies of triangulation in the binarized vein structures and (ii) from the geometrical features consisting of knuckle point perimeter distances in the acquired images. The weighted score level combination from these two matching scores are used to authenticate the individuals. The achieved experimental results from the proposed system using contactless palm dorsal-hand vein images are promising (equal error rate of 1.14%) and suggest more user friendly alternative for user identification.\",\n          \"Most existing joint neural models for Information Extraction (IE) use local task-specific classifiers to predict labels for individual instances (e.g., trigger, relation) regardless of their interactions. For example, a victim of a die event is likely to be a victim of an attack event in the same sentence. In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, OneIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. OneIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state of-the-art on all subtasks.

The knuckle tips are used as key points for the image normalization and extraction of region of interest. The matching scores are generated in two parallel stages: (i) hierarchical matching score from the four topologies of triangulation in the binarized vein structures and (ii) from the geometrical features consisting of knuckle point perimeter distances in the acquired images. The weighted score level combination from these two matching scores are used to authenticate the individuals.

In order to capture such cross-subtask and cross-instance inter-dependencies, we propose a joint neural framework, OneIE, that aims to extract the globally optimal IE result as a graph from an input sentence. OneIE performs end-to-end IE in four stages: (1) Encoding a given sentence as contextualized word representations; (2) Identifying entity mentions and event triggers as nodes; (3) Computing label scores for all nodes and their pairwise links using local classifiers; (4) Searching for the globally optimal graph with a beam decoder. At the decoding stage, we incorporate global features to capture the cross-subtask and cross-instance interactions. Experiments show that adding global features improves the performance of our model and achieves new state of-the-art on all subtasks.
